# Tech Stocks Analysis midst COVID-19 crisis
This is a statistical analysis of the stock movement and reaction of four "tech giants" midst the corona virus crisis. It's purpose is to explore how the tech industry's leading companies are responding to such an economic downturn. We achieve this by comparing their stock price movement and returns and by examining their interdependence. Finally, we make a risk assessment to check whether the comparison of the current market downfall with the 2008 economic crisis is actually valid regarding the tech industry. The companies we choose are Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

### Why tech industry?
The reason we are concerned with the tech industry is because it is the most interesting one. Technology is undeniably an integral part of people's lives in modern society. When we are not on our phone, we are behind a laptop's or tablet's screen. Especially now, more than ever, spending time in a quarantine leave most of the people with less (if any) other choices to spend their time on. Taking all of the above into consideration, someone may think that these companies, having revenues generated through online services and advertising would actually gain value through this process. But the stock market is governed by people, and people -especially in times of crisis- are subjected to their emotions and not rationality. That is what makes this analysis interesting and fun.

### Why these companies?
These four companies were chosen considering they are covering different aspects and operations of the tech industry. But let's examine this on greater detail:  

#### Why Amazon?
Amazon's revenues are coming in majority from the online store, along with third party seller and subscription services such as "amazon prime". A smaller portion comes from the Amazon's web services. So we could say that Amazon represents the "Online selling" part of tech industry.

#### Why Apple?
Apple is heavily relied on the sales of it's physical products such as phones, tablets, computers etc. With the physical stores being closed and with people being more reluctant to spend money on other than essential things due to the economic uncertainty it is interesting to see how Apple's value is affected. Apple is representing the "Hardware selling" part of the tech industry.

#### Why Google?
When we are referring to Google, we actually mean Alphabet, the company which contains Google and all relative services. We can see from the graph that revenues from advertising, either from Google Properties or Network Members, sum up to a whooping 85% of the company's total revenues. That makes Alphabet a good representative of the "Online advertisement" sector of the industry.

#### Why Microsoft?
One can describe Microsoft as a hybrid. We can see that the company draws revenues from multiple sectors such as online (cloud) services, software and programs like Windows and Office which are installed in every computer sold (other than Apple), devices such as Microsoft Surface and smartphones, and finally online platforms like LinkedIn and Bing which bring revenues through subsriptions and advertising. So, Microsoft is a well versed, balanced company and thus an interesting subject to include in our analysis.
